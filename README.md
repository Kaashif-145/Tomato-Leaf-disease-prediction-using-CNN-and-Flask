# Tomato-Leaf-disease-prediction-using-CNN-and-Flask
A CNN-based deep learning project for classifying tomato leaf images into 9 disease categories and 1 healthy class using the New Plant Diseases dataset from Kaggle. The model is deployed with a Flask web app, where users can upload leaf photos to get instant predictions and treatment suggestions. To run this project, create a virtual environment, install the required dependencies, and download the dataset directly from Kaggle. Only the code files are shared in this repository.
